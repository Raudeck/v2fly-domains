# v2fly-domains
This project aims to convert v2fly geosite format into sing-box format and create Clash ruleset for the use in Shadowrocket.

Based on [v2fly/domain-list-community](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community) and [blackmatrix7/ios_rule_script](https://github.com/blackmatrix7/ios_rule_script)

Since I'm not familiar with Go, partial code written in Go is based on [MetaCubeX/geo](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/geo) and implement a FFI for calling from Rust.
